## Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops Service on AWS

This Quick Start will deploy the necessary components for Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops service to use as a resource location on AWS. The deployment includes a hosted shared desktop and two sample published applications. This Quick Start is intended for users who want to accelerate a production implementation by automating the foundation setup, or for users who want to set up a trial deployment of Citrix Cloud.

Using the Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops service, you can deliver secure virtual apps and desktops to any device, and leave most of the product installation, setup, configuration, upgrades, and monitoring to Citrix. You maintain complete control over applications, policies, and users while delivering a high-quality user experience.

You can use the AWS CloudFormation templates included with the Quick Start to deploy the Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops service and infrastructure in your AWS account in about 90 minutes. The Quick Start automates the following:

- Deploying Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops service into a new VPC
- Deploying Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops service into an existing VPC

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
